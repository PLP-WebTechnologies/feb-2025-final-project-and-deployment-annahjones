        <p>
            Hello, I'm Ann Migwi, a poet, writer, and lover of words. My poetry is a reflection of my experiences, thoughts, and emotions. Through my words, I aim to connect with others and evoke feelings that resonate on a deeper level.
            <br><br>
            If you ever feel lost, undeserving, or unworthy, just seek within yourself the love that you give — it exists. Let’s make it till the end and create the best memories.
            <br><br>
            Most of my poems come from deep, raw emotions. I hope they inspire you to grow and know you aren't the only one going through a lot in life.
            <br><br>
            We all face ups and downs. I remind myself every day to give myself grace — to feel it all — because I was made to navigate this life, not perfectly, but fully.

        <h2>My Poetry</h2>
        <p>
            Poetry has always been a passion of mine, serving as an outlet for self-expression and creativity. I write about a variety of topics — love, struggle, nature, dark emotions, and the human experience. Each poem is crafted with care, and I hope they touch your heart.

            <h3>Whispers of the Night</h3>
            <p>
                In shadows deep where secrets lie,<br>
                The stars above begin to sigh.<br>
                My thoughts escape on midnight breeze,<br>
                And time stands still among the trees.

            <h3>Echoes of Silence</h3>
            <p>
                Silence speaks in subtle ways,<br>
                Through golden dawns and misty haze.<br>
                I find myself in lines I write,<br>
                A poet’s soul in quiet light.
