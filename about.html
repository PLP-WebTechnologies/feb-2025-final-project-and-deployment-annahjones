        <p>Hello, I'm Ann Migwi, a poet, writer, and lover of words. My poetry is a reflection of my experiences, thoughts, and emotions. Through my words, I aim to connect with others and evoke feelings that resonate on a deeper level. My work is a journey of self-discovery, and I invite you to explore the emotions and stories behind my poems.If you ever feel lost, undeserving, or unworthy, just seek within yourself the love that you give and exists. Lets make it till the end and make the best memories.
            Most poems are written from deep down, raw emotions. i hope they inspire you to grow, know you aren't the only one going through a alot in life.
            We all have ups and downs in life. I remind myself everyday that I should give myself so grace to feel all that I'm going through because I was made to navigate this life, not smoothly but with all the good and bad moments in brings.
